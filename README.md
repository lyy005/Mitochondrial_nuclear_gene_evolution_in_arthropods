# Rapid evolution of mitochondrion-related genes in haplodiploid arthropods

Sequences and Scripts used in the paper to estimate evolutionary rates and bootstrap analysis


## step0_sequences

a. Amino acid sequences of mitochondrial genes can be found under ./step0_sequences/

b. Amino acid sequences of nuclear genes

Due to the size limit of GitHub, the two nuclear gene files (arthropoda-seqs-all.zip and arthropoda-ortho-groups.txt) can be found here: https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13831339 or can be downloaded from https://i5k.gitlab.io/ArthroFam/arthropoda.html

Download the two files above and unzip arthropoda-seqs-all.zip to ./step0_sequences/nuclear_seq/


## step1_evolutionary_rate_estimation

a. ./step1_sequences_and_evolutionary_rate_estimation/arthropod_phylogeny.nwk - the phylogeny of 76 arthropod species, which is also available here: https://i5k.gitlab.io/ArthroFam/arthropoda.html

b. ./step1_sequences_and_evolutionary_rate_estimation/spp.list - the list of 76 arthropod species used in this study

c. Download all the amino acid sequences used in this study can be found here: https://i5k.gitlab.io/ArthroFam/arthropoda.html. Downloaded file names should be EOG8\*.fa. For example: EOG876NF7.fa

d. Gene list for each gene category: 

## step2_Rscripts_for_plotting - r scripts for plotting Figures 1 - 4, Figures S1 - S4

## step3_subsampling - scripts for subsampling for gene family size

## step4_SVM - r script and data for SVM model to detect gene family changes related to haplodiploid species
