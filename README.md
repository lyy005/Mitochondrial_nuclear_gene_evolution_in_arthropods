# Rapid evolution of mitochondrion-related genes in haplodiploid arthropods

Sequences and Scripts used in the paper to estimate evolutionary rates and bootstrap analysis


## step1_sequences_and_evolutionary_rate_estimation

a. ./step1_sequences_and_evolutionary_rate_estimation/arthropod_phylogeny.nwk - the phylogeny of 76 arthropod species, which is also available here: https://i5k.gitlab.io/ArthroFam/arthropoda.html

b. ./step1_sequences_and_evolutionary_rate_estimation/spp.list - the list of 76 arthropod species used in this study

d. Gene list for each gene category: 

## step2_Rscripts_for_plotting - r scripts for plotting Figure 1 - 5

## step3_subsampling - scripts for subsampling for gene family size

## step4_SVM - r script and data for SVM model to detect gene family changes related to haplodiploid species
